# MCUT

This is a Minecraft username tool written in Java. It allows you to enter a username to get its creation date. Original gist written by jomo [here](https://gist.github.com/jomo/be7dbb5228187edbb993).

## Usage

Compile it yourself or [download the JAR file from releases](https://github.com/masondaniels/MCUT/releases/download/0.0.1/tracker.jar).
Run the JAR file from the command line and enter the following to use:
``java -jar tracker.jar -username <username>``

##### Sidenote

This small repo also showcases my argument parsing classes. They are very handy if you develop in Java yourself. They are in the com.github.masondaniels.argumentparser package if you'd like to check them out. Usage of this argument parser is presented in the Main class of this repo. Perhaps I'll make a dedicated repo to it in the future.
